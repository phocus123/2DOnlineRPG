  npcIntroduction: Hi there adventurer, My name is Magnus and I am the guild leader
    of the Warriors Guild. Feel free to ask me questions.

    - dialogueLines:
      - There are 4 different guilds an adventurer may join. They are the Warriors
        guild, the Wizard's guild, the Archer's guild and the Priest's guild. Each
        guild has different abilities to learn.
      - If an adventurer joins a guild, they will get an experience discount to any
        abilities they learn from that guild. Only one guild can be joined but that
        does not mean you can't learn all the abilities from all the guilds.
    - dialogueLines:
      - Warrior's specialise in being at the front line of battle, often taking all
        the hits, because of this they are taught defensive abilities, helping them
        to take less damage and stay alive longer.
      - They are also taught abilities that ensure they are the target of all attacks
        to help keep their party alive.
    - dialogueLines:
      - You are now an honorary member of the warriors guild.
    - dialogueLines:
      - Of course, here you go.
    - dialogueLines:
      - Goodbye.
